POAP Artwork For Connext

Connext POAP template is a design with flexibility in mind. 

It has four stages (circle, square, pentagon and hexagon) and each of them is used to create a different POAP template for different events. Each of the inner shapes can be used to indicate the rank of a community member, not just with text but with shape!

Artwork inside the shape is interchangeable and can be swapped in for each event. I provided an example of the artwork featuring Connext color pallette.
